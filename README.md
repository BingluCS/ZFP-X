# ZFP-X

## Background

Todayâ€™s scientific simulations are confronting grave limited I/O bandwidth, network bandwidth, and storage capacity because of immense volumes of data generated in high-performance computing systems. Data compression has emerged as one of the most effective approaches to resolve the issue of the exponential increase of scientific data. Among them, embedded coding is widely applied, which contributes to the dominant running time for the corresponding compressors.

## ZFP-X
ZFP is one of the most successful compressors for scientific applications in high-performance computing systems and this work continues to be optimized. We propose a new embedded coding and apply it to ZFP, called ZFP-X. 

## Install
Replace the encode.c and decode.c files of the ZFP(https://github.com/LLNL/zfp) path "src/template/".
