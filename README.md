# ZFP-X
ZFP-X is an extended version of ZFP. ZFP-X has improved the embedded coding in the fixed-precision and fixed-accuracy mode of ZFP, which lead to the compression and decompression throughput achieved significant improvement.

## Background
Todayâ€™s scientific simulations are confronting grave limited I/O bandwidth, network bandwidth, and storage capacity because of immense volumes of data generated in high-performance computing systems. Data compression has emerged as one of the most effective approaches to resolve the issue of the exponential increase of scientific data. Among them, embedded coding is widely applied, which contributes to the dominant running time for the corresponding compressors.

## About ZFP-X
ZFP is one of the most successful compressors for scientific applications in high-performance computing systems and this work continues to be optimized. We propose a new embedded coding and apply it to ZFP, called ZFP-X.
